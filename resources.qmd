[**Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP-OBON)**](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON)

*This resource has repositories that include: Minimum Information about an Omics Protocol (MIOP) specifications, biomolecular protocol templates, protocol examples, and digital assets to connect BeBOP to ODIS & Ocean InfoHub.*

[**CalCOFI eDNA Protocols Repository**](https://github.com/CalCOFI/eDNA-protocols)

*BeBOP-formatted protocols for collecting and processing eDNA samples on CalCOFI surveys. Under development, check back soon for more protocols!*

[**NOAA 'omics data management guide**](https://github.com/aomlomics/omics-data-management)

*This guide was created to help 'omics users decide which data goes to which repositories (NCEI, NCBI, etc.), and how to deposit their data so that it will be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), including following community standards for raw data, processed data, and contextual metadata and environmental data.*

[**A WC-OBON endorsed molecular methods guide**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rDubDv8d1tieoLY2NQZedbSR4-8lsIoafH266XKmtTo/edit#gid=1024107459)

*This guide includes information to help decision making for marker gene amplification and sequencing. This includes all protocols from member institutions of WC-OBON.*

[**rCRUX: A rapid and versatile tool for generating reference libraries in R**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/CalCOFI/rCRUX__;!!Mih3wA!FMJUjlH2h1Yuxw7_q2iqC1r6LOKMjpUuSm6zgU77iYcleNHzvF2OXbB4WjkLC_bb52zwTZNmMEFr1-WE9QNNMj5PTLu-$)
